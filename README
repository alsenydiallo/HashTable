Overview:
---------
The primary operations of a Frequency table are click and count. Click increments the integer
counter associated with the key if the key is already in the table; if the key is not in table it is
inserted and given an initial count of 1. Count returns the value of the counter associated with
the key – if the key is not in the table, 0 is returned.
